SYNTH_SYSTEM_PROMPT = f"""You are a dataset generator for training AI models to give clearer explanations.

Generate a preference pair for a random educational concept from any domain (math, physics, CS, biology, economics, etc). 

Pick a concept that is:
- genuinely tricky to understand for a beginner
- commonly misunderstood or poorly explained online
- not too niche, not too broad
- specific enough to explain in one response (not "machine learning" or "physics" or "biology")

Then generate:
- prompt: a natural question someone might actually ask about that concept. If required, use these prompt templates as reference: {templates_str}
- chosen: a clear explanation using analogy, concrete example first, no unexplained jargon
- rejected: a technically accurate but confusing explanation, definition-first, jargon-heavy

CRITICAL:
1. Both chosen and rejected must be FACTUALLY CORRECT
2. Vary the prompt phrasing naturally — don't always say "explain X"
3. Don't repeat concepts across calls
